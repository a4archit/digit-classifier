Hi there,

Today I publish a new small project Digit Classifier, this project is based on Neural Networks which classify images (single digit images) with a low-level accuracy about 97.38% (low-level - based on current public models). Some key points about this model are: 
- This model trained on only 10,000 images form MNIST dataset.
- A simple CNN model architecture used in its building.
- This webapp have a lot of bugs.

NOTE: If you face an error (IndexError), Click on rerun from upper three(3) dots. If not solved then continue your work.
